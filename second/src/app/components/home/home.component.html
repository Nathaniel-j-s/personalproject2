  <h1>Property Management Aid</h1>
  <p class="lead">Welcome to my personal project, the Property Management Aid. This is a solo, full-stack project for DevMountain. This is not a website ready for production, but rather a test drive of Angular 2 and MongoDB.</p>

    <h3>MEAN Stack</h3>
    <p>I'm using MongoDB, Express, Angular 2, and Node.js. It may be complicated, but it's super awesome and I'm proud of it. If you play around a little, you'll see that it loads incredibly quickly even with relatively slow internet speeds.</p>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h3>Angular CLI</h3>
    <p>The Angular CLI has been used to generate my components, services, etc. This makes for easy compilation with Webpack.</p>

    <h3>JWT Tokens</h3>
    <p>Full featured authentication using JSON web tokens. Login and store user data. It is not full-fledged security as you would expect from a production app, so don't use real emails or passwords. It does, however, verify that you used proper email format and encrypt passwords such that I also don't have access to them, so that's good.</p>

    <h3>Other Tech</h3>
    <p>Bootstrap was used for the extremely quick design work. This is hosted on Digital Ocean, but certainly does not yet have a domain, although if I can add more functionality I would like to get one. My images are actually NOT being stored anywhere fancy like s3. They are just placeholders. I am currently working on a different project, but afterwards I plan to come back and add a geniune calendar module and then potentially a drag-and-drop map for each property.</p>
